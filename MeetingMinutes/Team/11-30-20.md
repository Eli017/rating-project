## Things Clarified
- Review Team Rules:
  - If you're assigned a PR to review, you should do it within 24 hours of it being assigned.
  - If you're absent for a meeting, post the reason in the channel beforehand.
  - If you're messaged specifically in the channel or in a DM, respond within 24 hours.
  - Check your email on a daily (whenever you get up).
  - On a daily, in Slack, post your status:
    - Y: What you did yesterday.
    - T: What you are working on today.
    - S: What struggles you have.
    - Example:
      - Y: I did some tests.
      - T: I'm going to do more tests.
      - S: Nothing is blocking me.
- We can store these rules in a Slack pinned message.
