# **TechStack**
## **Front-end**
### [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- We will be using Vue.js for front-end development as this is the language requested by the client as they are currently using this to write their own programs. This will allow them to continue developing the app after it is fully turned over to them.
## **Back-end**
### [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- We will be using Node.js to develop back-end service for the project as requested by the client as this is their current language they use for back-end development. This will allow them to implement fixes/changes to the project after it is completed at the end of the year.
## **Server**
### [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)
- For hosting the project, the client will be responsibe for hosting it on Azure as it is what they are currently using to host their other applications for themselves and other clients.
## **Security**
### [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)
- We will be using Auth0 integration to allow secure logins for users to access the application. The client already uses the service for other applications on site.
