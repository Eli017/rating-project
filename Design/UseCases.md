# **Use Cases**
## **Actors**
### Admins
- The admin is the administrator of the entire program, and the administrator has the authority to allow or prevent FTE and apprentices from accessing the rating program.

### FTEs (full-time employees)
- FTEs can evaluate apprenticesâ€™ performance through programs, including rating a student from 1 dot to 5 dots, and optionally writing a note.

### Apprentices
- Apprentices need to obtain FTEs' evaluation of their performance in the project through this program, and apprentices can know their scores and comments left by FTMs.

## **Use Cases**
- UC1: Rating apprentices
  - This is a use case because the functionality of this feature is the main goal of our product. This use case is an example  of how our BR1 would work. This would involve all three of our actors, Admins, FTEs and Apprentices
