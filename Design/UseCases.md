# **Use Cases**
## **Actors**
### Admins
- The admin is the administrator of the entire program, and the administrator has the authority to allow or prevent FTE and apprentices from accessing the rating program.

### FTEs (full-time employees)
- FTEs can evaluate apprenticesâ€™ performance through programs, including rating a student from 1 dot to 5 dots, and optionally writing a note.

### Apprentices
- Apprentices need to obtain FTEs' evaluation of their performance in the project through this program, and apprentices can know their scores and comments left by FTMs.
