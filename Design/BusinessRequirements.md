Through creating this application they plan to use this app, and its features, to better help their Apprentices understand their skills. They will then be able to take this feedback and improve upon it, working on their weak areas to improve them, and being able to ask questions of their peers and the Full Time Employees (FTE) to steer them in the right direction.
