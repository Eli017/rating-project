# Business Requirements:

- BR1 :
Employee X needs to be able to rate apprentices in multiple categories on a scale of 1 to 5.
  - The first meeting we had with EduSource this was the main requirement that they needed the app to complete. This would allow their apprentices to learn their strengths and   better understand their weaknesses. Throughout our entire conversation this is what they kept coming back to being the most important. 

- BR2 :
Employee X needs to be able to log into the application.
  - For an application that will be saving information on different people this will be necessary. This will allow for a more user-oriented system that will be able to show each employee the ratings they've given. This will also allow each employee to keep track of the growth of their apprentice and help them figure out how to strengthen their weaknesses better.

- BR3 :
Apprentices need to be able to see only their ratings.
  - This will allow the apprentices to see their weaknesses and strengths, based on the reviews of their peers and seniors. Throught this they will be able to go about strengthening their weaknesses while improving upon their strengths. This will also allow them to be able to show to future employees what their strengths and weaknesses are based off these ratings.

- BR4 :
Employee X needs to be able leave comments for apprentices.
  - This will allow the apprentice to know where they are falling short in a given subject. Through this they will be able to work on it and grow. This will also allow for the senior to show them their strengths as well and perhaps even point them towards ways to improve their weaknesses or further their strengths.

- BR5 :
Apprentice needs to see who left what ratings
  - Through doing this, the apprentice will know who to talk to about any questions they may have on the  rating and why they received the number they did. This will open opportunities for the senior to direct and tutor the apprentice further, and will allow the apprentice to gain a better understanding of their rating.

- BR6 :
Different Leads need to have different weight on their ratings, based on area of rating.
  - This will allow for those who have expertise in that area to have more say in what went well and what didn't. This will open ways for predictive analytics for the rating system and will allow the apprentices to know who to talk to easier about different areas of expertise, based on the weight of these ratings.
